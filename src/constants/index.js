export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m Surya Prakash, from the beautiful city of Chennai. I have three years of experience in IT recruitment, where I was responsible for profile sourcing, interview scheduling, interview coordination, and managing the end-to-end onboarding process.

Although my background is in recruitment, my passion for technology led me to transition into web development. My interest in this field began when a college colleague developed a web page for my previous organization. Inspired by his work, I decided to explore web development, which led me to pursue a postgraduate degree in Information Technology from Madras University in 2024. Currently, I am enhancing my skills by taking a Web Development course at Soft Logic Academy.
